# C++ Y Intercept Calculator

## Overview
I have virtually tutored math for a few years now and one thing that I always end up showing repeatedly are the steps for finding the y intercept of a line with a given slope that passes through a specified point. Because of this, I created a resource that outlines what is happening each step of the way so a student could use it and see what is happening behind the scenes if they would like.
